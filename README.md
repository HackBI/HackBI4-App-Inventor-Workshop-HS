# App Inventor Workshop 

## Get Started
1. Go to http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu on the internet
2. Create a google account or sign in using a google account you already have

## Uses
App Inventor 2 is used to create applications that can be used on phones.

## Purpose
This workshop's purpose is to teach participants:

1. How to change the visual aspect of an app by dragging components from the Palette and dropping them into the Designer
2. How to initialize and increment the value of a variable
3. How to store and access values using TinyDB
4. How to create and use a procedure to make code easier to understand
5. How to use lists and how to nest a list inside another list

## Goal
This workshop's goal is to help participants create an app that assesses the user’s knowledge of the internet and tells the user which of his answers are correct or incorrect. 

## Challenges
1. Create a “Return to Home” button that will allow the user to return to Screen1 (the opening screen) when the current question index is greater than the length of the question list.
2. Make a label under the progress bar that shows the percentage of answers the user has answered. To do this challenge, you will need the totalAnsweredQuestions variable, the totalQuestions variable, a division block, and a multiplication block. 
3. Make a different picture show up for each question. To be able to use pictures in your app, you need to enter the Designer and click the “Upload File” button under the Media section. To do this challenge, you will need to make a list of text strings, call it “pictureList”, and give each text string an image’s file name (ie. “dogPicture.png”). You will also need the block that says “set Image.picture to”.
